## [Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363283&tag=1)
This paper focuses on immersion, a list of VR interfaces and two controllers that were used for testing purposes, Xbox One and Hydra controllers. Two games were tested with these, DREAMS and EREBUS, and were evaluated by students. While the users felt comfortable using the Xbox One controllers, they grew to understand the Hydra ones and felt comfortable enough to label both controllers equally comprehensible. Results showed that while both games contained considerable motion sickness, it was more noticeable in EREBUS. However, it is important to note that EREBUS was more of an action-adventure game (despite there being no mention of player movement in both games) in comparison to DREAMS, which was a puzzle game. 


## [Exploitation of heuristics for virtual environments](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2399065)
This paper focuses on heuristics analysis that were proposed by Sutcliffe and Gault and their exploitations. While Nielsen's heuristics have been hugely popular, they are too generic to be used in specific areas. As a result, new methods have been proposed. The papers that were examined used a hand-few selected heuristics and were adapted to suit their own needs. Finally, results showed that only 10/12 heuristic categories had issues. As a whole, this paper aims to help us understand heuristic tests and their potential. 


## [Investigating the balance between virtuality and reality in mobile mixed reality UI design: user perception of an augmented city](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2641201)
This paper discusses user's view on augmented reality in comparison to augmented virtuality UIs in a mobile application. A list of 35 participants were involved in the field study who interacted with a mobile mixed reality game that had two different UI designs, including an online survey by over 100 people. One design was an augmented camera view and the other being a virtual 3D city model. This paper helps us understand how we can potentially merge mixed reality UI and virtual reality UI. 


## [Homuncular Flexibility in Virtual Reality.](http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=df871a56-6360-4d60-a9b4-8c51ee6bc4f8%40sessionmgr4008&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=102884181&db=ufh)

This paper explores the idea of having users adapt and immerse themselves in VR by having them inhabit non-human avatars, as well as the psychological and physiological effects they produce. An example of an experiment mentioned was the "rubber hand illusion", where participants saw and observed a rubber hand on a table infront of them being stroked by a soft brush while feeling synchronous touch on their real hand under the table, eventually flinching when they felt it was threatened. These are the kind of results that are effective and wanted towards having an immersive VR experience.


## [(Re-)examination of multimodal augmented reality](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=3001961)
There is no concrete definition of what Augmented Reality is. This is why Milgram and Kishino have attempted to create distinctions between the different realities, which are the real, mediated and virtual world. Real being the physical world, mediated meaning percieving real world data through digital forms and virtual being computer generated objects viewed through a digital form. Overall, this paper discusses various ways to view AR.
